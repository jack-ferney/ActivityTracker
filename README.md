# Running and Biking Activity Tracker!

## About this program:

I am really interested in **biking, running** and **fitness** and I love looking into the *data* regarding my activities
and being able to see where my areas of improvement are and how I performed on specific **runs/rides**. With this project
I would like to design a program that users can **add their activities to, view and receive an overview of their activity, 
see past activities and edit or delete them and set a variety of activity related goals.** I feel this would be of great
use to active and goal oriented athletes like myself or anyone who wishes to track their fitness.
